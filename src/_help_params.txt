params = "<start-number> <sequence> <sequence> ..."

  defines the characteristics of the expression.
  at least <start-number> and one <sequence> must be specified.

  <start-number>:
    initial number in the format "sX", where X is any number (including negative and decimal fractions),
    or "r" - generate randomly from <range> and <decimal> from the first <sequence>.

  <sequence> = "<kind><seq_params>":
    <kind>:
      defines the "type" of sequence:
        "a" - An arithmetic progression.
        "r" - Generate numbers randomly.
        "c" - Covering all possible combinations of the category of units.
    <seq_params>:
      parameters for <seq_params> consist of two sections: required arguments and optional.
      if optional arguments are specified - they are separated by a colon:

        <seq_params> = "<required>:<optional>"

      for <kind> = "a":
        the first number of the progression will be the result of the left part of the expression.
        <required>:
          required parameters, separated by commas, specified in strict order:

            <required> = "<diff>,<length>"

          <diff>
            The difference between the numbers.
            any number (including negative and decimal fractions), by default - none.
          <length>
            The length of the progression.
            any natural number, by default - none.

        <optional>:
          optional parameters:

            <optional> = ":<roundtrip>"

          <roundtrip> = "<" (default disabled):
            add a copy of the inverted version of the resulting expression to the end:
              - mirror the sequence of numbers
              - convert + to -, * to / and vice versa

      for <kind> = "r" or "c":
        <required>:
          required parameters (except <length> for <kind>="c"), separated by commas,
          specified in strict order:

            <required> = "<operands>,<range>,<length>"

          <operands>:
            which operands to use. options: "+", "-", "*", "/".
            if multiple operands are specified, they will be selected randomly for each new number.
            after each operand, you can specify priority (any natural number - default "1").
          <range>:
            Range for generating numbers in the format "x-y", where "x" and "y" are any natural numbers.
            Decimal precision will be automatically considered.
            Cannot be negative - this effect is achieved through operands and their priorities.
          <length> (optional for kind=cover)
            the length of the sequence, where <length> is any natural number.
            for kind=cover it is optional, once all combinations are covered - generate numbers randomly.

        <optional>:
          optional parameters, not separated by each other, specified in random order:

            <optional> = ":<allow-negative><decimal><roundtrip>"

          <allow-negative> = "n" (default disabled):
            if start-number >= 0 allow going into negative.
            if start-number < 0 allow going below the initial start-number.
          <decimal> = ".x%%y" (default disabled):
            randomly add decimal fractions with precision up to "x" decimal places,
            where "x" is any natural number. by default - none.
            you can specify the probability in percent at the end with "%%y",
            where "y" is a natural number from 0 to 100 (default %%50).
          <roundtrip> = "<" (default disabled):
            add a copy of the inverted version of the resulting expression to the end:
              - mirror the sequence of numbers
              - convert + to -, * to / and vice versa
